# Google Homepage

I created a webpage that mimics the Google.co.uk homepage 

Project from The Odin Project - https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css

## What I learned
+ How to use both HTML and CSS together
+ Using inspect element to understand how parts of the webpage is created, it was especialy useful for getting the colours and font/font-sizes for text
+ I also got a better understandf of how GIT works
